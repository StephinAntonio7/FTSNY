This webpage was created to inform the user of Feed The Streets NY and the ways in which they can support the non-profit organization.

Mission: NYC homelessness and hunger knows no bounds. In a city of more than 8.3 million people, nearly one in every 83 New Yorkers is homeless. To address this need, Feed The Streets NY facilitates weekly hand-to-hand distribution of clothing, hygiene supplies, a hot meal and haircuts to any New Yorker in need. For anyone facing material hardship, New York City can be an unforgiving place to live. Thatâ€™s why we show up, rain, shine, sleet or snow. New volunteers are welcome!
